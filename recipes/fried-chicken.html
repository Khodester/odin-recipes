        <h2>Steps to Making this Fried Chicken</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Lets get the chicken washed up and rinsed and dried.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl lets get all the spices and chicken to become family.</li>
            <li>As previously said before we don't use measurements for spices so lets eyeball them into the mixing
                bowl with the chicken.
            </li>
            <li>When ready to cook chicken we add flour and an egg for help with binding to the mix.</li>
            <li>Lets get a pan or pot filled with oil. Only enough to cover about half the chicken. Drop a few in
                after the oil is nice and hot on medium high heat. Letting each side cook until well browned to ensure 
                chicken is cooked throughout.
            </li>
        </ol>
