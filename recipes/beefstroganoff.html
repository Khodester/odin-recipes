        <div class="title steps">Steps to Creating this Dish</div>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a pot or pan to a boil with water salt and oil. Add pasta once boiled.</li>
            <li>While waiting for water to boil, let's start cutting the veggies. First
                cut mushrooms to desired thickness and medium dice onions and add some onions
                (the rest will be used later) to boiling water with the pasta. Mince garlic.</li>
            <li>Get a separate pot or pan big enough for the whole dish. Add oil to pot
                or pan and once heated enough add minced garlic. Once browned add your choice
                of ground meat. Get that fully cooked and seasoned with all the spices. I will
                not have any measurements, coming from a cambodian background my ancestors 
                did not measure anything and just went by taste. So start slow with the 
                seasoning and adjust as you go.
            </li>
            <li>With the well seasoned meat add in mushrooms and the rest of the onions you
                saved for later. Let all that come together and get the mushrooms and onions
                to soften up.
            </li>
            <li>Grab a sauce bowl or just about a half cup of the pasta water and save for later.
            </li>
            <li>Lets get that al dente pasta and onions out and drain the remaining water out. 
                That will all be added to the other pot/pan with meat and veggies.
            </li>
            <li>Lets throw in the alfredo sauce now with the meat and veggies. And add that pasta
                water into the alfredo jar to get some more of that sauce out and added to mixture.
            </li>
            <li>Lastly add the pasta and onions to the mix. Stir all together. Taste and adjust
                flavor as needed. And now you have finished the beef stroganoff.
            </li>
        </ol>
